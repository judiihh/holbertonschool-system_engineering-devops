# 🌐 Web Infrastructure Design Project

This project focuses on designing and documenting web infrastructure architectures, from simple to complex setups, with a focus on security, monitoring, and scalability.

## 📋 Project Requirements

### 🎯 General Requirements
- Create diagrams covering different web infrastructure designs
- Explain each component's functionality and purpose
- Understand system redundancy and high availability
- Document security and monitoring considerations
- Explain scaling strategies

### ✅ Task Requirements
1. For each task:
   - Create a diagram using Mermaid
   - Document the infrastructure design
   - Explain component purposes and interactions
   - Detail security and monitoring considerations
   - Push the documentation to GitHub

### 🔑 Key Concepts to Cover
- Web server vs Application server roles
- Load balancing and high availability
- Database replication and clustering
- SSL/TLS and security measures
- Monitoring and metrics collection
- Infrastructure scaling strategies

## 📁 Project Structure
- `README.md` - This file
- `0-simple_web_stack` - Basic single-server web infrastructure
- `1-distributed_web_infrastructure` - Three-server distributed setup
- `2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure` - Secure and monitored infrastructure
- `3-scale_up` - Scaled-up infrastructure with dedicated servers

## 📝 Notes
- Each infrastructure design builds upon the previous one
- Focus on practical, production-ready solutions
- Consider security, monitoring, and scalability
- Document all design decisions and their rationale
- Use clear, professional English in all documentation
